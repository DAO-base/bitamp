                        Last Update: May 12th, 2020
                        <br><br>We’d like to take this opportunity to welcome you to Bitamp. This client-sided Bitcoin wallet was made to interact with the blockchain. We value your privacy. 
                        <br><br>Please note that Bitamp doesn’t collect any data passively. We don’t monetize data collection or use it for marketing or advertising purposes. Moreover, we don’t store your account information or your passwords. We also don’t collect, store, or hold your keys. 
                        <br><br>Any personal information we have on file to you is subject to this privacy policy. Here we’ll attempt to help you understand how we collect, use, and share information. 
                        <br><br>This Policy is applicable to anyone who accesses our services in any form. By visiting our site, you acknowledge that we will collect, use, and share information in the manner we describe below. 
                        <br><br>For the purposes of this Policy, when we use the term “personal information,” we are referring to any information about a person that can allow that person to be identified. That might include the person’s name, his or her telephone number, and an email address. The information can be used on its own or combined with information from other sources. 

                        <br><br><b>Privacy and Transparency on the Blockchain</b>
                        <br><br>Many blockchains are inherently transparent places, and because of that, the transactions you complete with Bitamp may be publicly accessible. Any information that a given blockchain stores may not only be public, but immutable as well, and it can be impossible to eliminate completely. Any transaction you complete and any address you use to complete transaction might reveal information about your identity that can be correlated with other information at any point in time by any individual or agency. Be sure you understand how both privacy and transparency work on the blockchain. 

                        <br><br><b>The Information You Provide</b>
                        <br><br>We gather information about you in the manner which we describe below. We use that information to enhance our services and your experiences within our services. 
                        <br><br>We might collect the personal information you choose to provide when you work with given functions of our site. If you email us, for instance, you choose to provide us with your email address. If you participate in a free offer, you also provide the information necessary within that offer. 
                        <br><br>Please note that we do not track users over time, nor do we track users across any third party website for targeted ad purposes, so we do not respond to any Do Not Track signals. 

                        <br><br><b>How We Use Your Information</b>
                        <br><br>The information you provide us with is used for support and our services.
                        <br><br>We can use any personal information we collect from you to offer you information about our services that you’ve requested. We can also use it to monitor your usage trends and analyse them. Furthermore, we may work to use that data to personalise and improve the services we offer and the way you experience those services. Should you provide consent, we may also use them for any other purpose.

                        <br><br><b>When We Share</b>
                        <br><br>We don’t disclose your information in any way other than the ways we’re about to describe. We would never sell your information. 
                        <br><br>We may share or disclose your information if we need it to fulfill the reason you gave it to us, if you consent for us to share it, if we need to do so for legal and safety purposes, if we are required to comply with court orders or laws, if we must protect the rights of others like Service Providers, employees, or customers. 
                        <br><br>Service Providers are those third parties we contract to perform functions that might relate to our services. They will have access to your personal information, but only that information that is necessary to perform their function. They are not allowed to use or share that information for any purpose outside of their functions. 

                        <br><br><b>Third Party Links</b>
                        <br><br>Our services contain many links to other websites and applications. Once you click on a link, you’re leaving our site and you will be redirected to a third-party site or application. This means that you will no longer be governed by this policy. 

                        <br><br><b>Minor Privacy</b>
                        <br><br>Our services are not directed to children under the age of 13. They are not able to use our services, and we do not knowingly collect their information. Should we learn someone under the age of 13 is using our services, we will take steps to prevent that user from doing so and remove the personal information from our database. 

                        <br><br><b>Protecting Your Information</b>
                        <br><br>We believe protecting your information is absolutely essential, so we’ve taken a number of steps to help safeguard it. Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee the security measures we’ve taken. In some circumstances, you have these rights.
                        <ul>
                        <li>Accessibility: You have the right to request information about the personal information we have about you. You may request one copy at absolutely no cost, but should you request other copies, we have the right to charge a fee for that information.</li>
                        <li>Rectification: You have the right to rectify incomplete or inaccurate information we have on file about you. </li>
                        <li>Restriction: You have the right to restrict how we use your personal information. </li>
                        <li>Portability: You have the right to request we give you the information we have in a machine readable format. You also have the right to request the information be sent to another company.</li>
                        <li>Objection: You have the right to object to anywhere we may use your personal information. </li>
                        </ul>
                        If you have any requests with regard to those rights, please email us. 

                        <br><br><b>Processing Informational Legally</b>
                        <br><br>We do rely on your consent to process your personal information to offer support to you and for you to participate in promotions. You can withdraw your consent. 
                        <br><br><b>Retaining Your Information</b>
                        <br><br>We retain the information you give us for six months if you request support and for 90 days if you participate in a promotion. 
                        <br><br><b>Changes to our Policy</b>
                        <br><br>We may make changes to the way we handle information from time to time. Should we decide to do so, we will change the last updated date at the top of the page. Should you continue to use our services after those changes have been published, you automatically consent to the changes. 
                        <br><br>Please contact us if you have any questions.
